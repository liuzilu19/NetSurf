TTF2f Changelog
===============

0.03 (15-Aug-2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No longer create language fonts, as the font manager appears capable
of handling encoding files with /uniXXXX for symbol fonts. Quite why
this behaviour didn't appear to work when originally tested, I've no
idea. This change avoids any necessity to move Encodings files around.

0.02 (10-Sep-2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remove buggy metrics code which caused fonts with <= 256 different 
horiAdvance values to have broken glyph spacings. All fonts now use 
the extended table format where the glyph number is the table index.
(Thanks to Paul Sprangers for reporting this)

Fix for fonts which don't embed glyph names (or use incorrect ones).
The glyph names are now retrieved from the Glyphs file. The format 
of the Glyphs file is as per the Adobe Glyph List comment. TTF2f
uses only columns 1 and 2.

Improve multitasking when extracting glyph metrics.
