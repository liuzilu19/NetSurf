TTF2f
-----

TTF2f converts TTF and other font formats supported by FreeType2 
(http://www.freetype.org) to RISC OS format fonts suitable for use with
the Unicode Font Manager.

NOTE: Please read the section "Converting a font" as a minimum _before_ 
      using this software.

1. Converting a font
====================

  In order to convert a font, follow the following process:

    1) Run the application and open the main window.
    2) Drag the source font file to the window - the file path will appear 
       in the Converting display field.
    3) Choose a RISC OS font name for the font and enter it into the 
       Fontname writable field.
    4) Select the location to save the output font from the drop down menu
       (this is comprised of all entries in your current Font$Path)
    5) Click convert and wait for conversion to complete.

2. Progress Bar
===============

  During the conversion process, the progress bar will be filled three 
  times - once per file being created. This is indicated by the colour of
  the bar:

    Dark Green indicates that the glyph metrics are being extracted.
    Red indicates that the IntMetrics file is being written.
    Blue indicates that the Outlines file is being written.
    Green indicates that the Encoding file is being written.


3. Future Enhancements
======================

  There are a number of possible enhancements which could be made to TTF2f.

  1) Kerning data.

     At present, any kerning data present in the source font is ignored. It
     may be desirable to copy this data across into the RISC OS IntMetrics
     file.

  2) Improve conversion speed.

     TTF2f is not particularly fast at conversion, although in most cases
     conversion time should be acceptable. Particularly large fonts do take
     some time to convert (for example; BitStream.Cyberbit (a font  
     containing about 30,000 glyphs which cover much of the common Unicode 
     character range) takes approximately 25 minutes to convert on my 
     Iyonix).


4. Known Issues
===============

  At the time of writing there is one known issue.

  1) Attempts to quit TTF2f whilst conversion is occuring will be ignored 
     (this includes use of Alt-Break).
