JSON-C patches
==============

This directory contains a couple of patches to JSON-C 0.7.
Upstream sources may be found at http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/

hex-chars.jmb1.p:

  Fix handling of upper case hex digits.
  The previous behaviour resulted in the likes of \uFFFD causing a parse
  error.

void-prototypes.jmb1.p:

  Fix compiler warnings about function prototypes in header files when
  compiling client code in standards mode with pedantic warnings switched
  on.

Apply them as follows:

  $ cd json-c-0.7
  $ patch -p 1 -i ../hex-chars.jmb1.p
  $ patch -p 1 -i ../void-prototypes.jmb1.p

They have been submitted upstream, so will probably disappear in due 
course.
