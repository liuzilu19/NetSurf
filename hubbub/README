Hubbub -- an HTML parser
========================

Overview
--------

  Hubbub is a flexible HTML parser. It aims to comply with the HTML5
  specification.

Requirements
------------

  Hubbub requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Perl (for the testcases)
    + Pkg-config (for the testcases)
    + xsltproc (for the entity fetcher)
    + wget (for the entity fetcher)

  Hubbub also requires the following libraries to be installed:

    + An iconv implementation (e.g. libiconv)
    + JSON-C (for the testcases) -- see json/README for further information

  Hubbub can make use of the following, for debugging and testing purposes:

    + gcov and lcov, for test coverage data


Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the parser is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

  If you wish to see test coverage statistics, run:

  		$ make coverage

  Then open the build/coverage/index.html file in a web browser.


API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources 
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
