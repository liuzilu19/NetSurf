Hubbub -- an HTML parser
========================

Overview
--------

  Hubbub is a flexible HTML parser. It aims to comply with the HTML5
  specification.

Requirements
------------

  Hubbub requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Perl (for the testcases)
    + Pkg-config (for the testcases)
    + xsltproc (for the entity fetcher)
    + wget (for the entity fetcher)

  Hubbub also requires the following libraries to be installed:

    +  An iconv implementation (e.g. libiconv)
    +  JSON-C (for the testcases) -- see json/README for further information

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the parser is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources 
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
