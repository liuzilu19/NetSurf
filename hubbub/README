Hubbub -- an HTML parser
========================

Overview
--------

  Hubbub is a flexible HTML parser. It aims to comply with the HTML5
  specification.

Requirements
------------

  Hubbub requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Perl (for the testcases)
    + Pkg-config (for the testcases)
    + xsltproc (for the entity fetcher)
    + wget (for the entity fetcher)
    + doxygen (for the API documentation)

  Hubbub also requires the following libraries to be installed:

    + An iconv implementation (e.g. libiconv)
    + LibParserUtils -- see below for further information
    + JSON-C (for the testcases) -- see below for further information

  Hubbub can make use of the following, for debugging and testing purposes:

    + gcov and lcov, for test coverage data


Compilation
-----------

  In order to compile Hubbub, you will need LibParserUtils.  This can be
  obtained from SVN:
  		$ svn co svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libparserutils/

  In order to run tests, you will need JSON-C.  You can obtain the version
  that Hubbub needs from SVN:
  		$ svn co svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/json-c/json-c/


  Compile and install both of these before trying to make Hubbub.


  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the parser is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

  If you wish to see test coverage statistics, run:

  		$ make coverage

  Then open the build/coverage/index.html file in a web browser.


API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The "examples" 
  directory contains commented examples of how to use hubbub.
