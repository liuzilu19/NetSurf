Bottom left

<div style="background:#fcc; margin:1em; padding:1em;">

<p>There is a frameset with two rows and two columns. The bottom right location is another frameset with two frames in it.</p>

<p>The left column of the outer frameset has a fixed width of 800px and the right column uses the remaining space.</p>

<p>When the window width is reduced to less than 800px, the entire bottom row of frames disappears. The top row is fine.</p>
