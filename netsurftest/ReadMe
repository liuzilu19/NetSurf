NetSurf test cases are split into the following directories:

	crashes/		For test cases that cause crashes
	haveproblems/		For test cases that have problems
	works/			For any test case that works

	images/			For images used by the test cases



Please try to make test cases as self contained as possible.

Put CSS data in a STYLE tag or attribute, rather than in an external file.
