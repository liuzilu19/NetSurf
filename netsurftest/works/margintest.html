<h1>HTML Margin test</h1>
<p>This page is meant to demonstrate what happens when a margin is set on the HTML tag itself.
This is achieved by the user of some CSS in <tt>margintest.css</tt> which looks like this:</p>
<pre>html {
    margin: 1em;
}</pre>
<p>This should put a <tt>1em</tt> margin around the entire page which should not be clipped by
the window at any point; nor should it cause the links to be offset etc.</p>
<p>Before if this is broken/a problem then the following link's
hotspot within browser windows will be offset up/left by <tt>1em</tt> and the window itself
will not scroll properly to the bottom.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="margintest.html">link</a> to myself.</p>
