<div style="float:left; width:450px; padding-top:5em;">
	<div style="position:absolute; top:0; right:0; color:red;">
		Absolute positioned
	</div>

	<p>
		When an absolute positioned element is the first child of a
		float with a top padding, the following children which are
		in &quot;normal flow&quot; are not positioned with respect
		to the top padding, but float children are. Other padding
		(e.g. left) is no problem.
