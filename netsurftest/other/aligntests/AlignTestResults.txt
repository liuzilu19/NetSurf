ALIGNMENT TEST RESULTS
======================

In the absence of a summary, skip to the conclusion for the overview.


Key:

  + Standards and Quirks modes are tantamount
  - Standards and Quirks modes exhibit differing behaviour

Note 1: Only test IDs that demonstrate something that couldn't be predicted
        from preceding test results are commented on.
Note 2: Where quirks mode layout is the same as standards mode, no comment
        is made.



Firefox
-------

Standards:

1+ CENTER centers a child DIV and the inline contents of that DIV, where no
   other alignment modifiers exist
2+ CENTER centers any descendant DIVs and the inline or block level
   contents of those DIVs, where no other alignment modifiers exist; DIV
   permits propagation of CENTER behaviour
3+
4+ A TABLE child of CENTER is centered and inline contents of the TABLE
   cells (TD) are left aligned, where no other alignment modifiers exist
5+ CENTER effect propagation is blocked by a TABLE; inline and block level
   children of TABLE cells (TD) are left aligned
6+
7+
8+ DIV elements with the ALIGN attribute set block propagation of the
   effects of CENTER. DIV alignment attributes' effects propagate to
   descendants, in the absence of other alignment modifiers. DIV alignment
   affects descendant inline and block level elements
9+
a+ TD elements with ALIGN attribute set block propagation of the effects
   of CENTER. TD alignment attributes' effects propagate to descendants, in
   the absence of other alignment modifiers. TD alignment affects descendant
   inline and block level elements
b+
c+
d+
e+
f+
g+
h+ CENTER blocks propagation of a TD alignment attribute.
i+
j+ CENTER blocks propagation of a DIV alignment attribute.
k+
l+
m+
n+
o+
p+ CENTER propagates through floated elements, irrespective of the float
   properties' settings
q+ DIV alignment attributes' effects propagate through floated elements,
   irrespective of the float properties' settings

Quirks:

 + [All tests perform as for standards mode]


Conclusion (Firefox)
--------------------

Firefox's behaviour for various types of alignment markup is consistent,
predictable and follows very simple rules.

CENTER, and DIVs, TDs and THs with an align attribute all behave in the
same way:

 + Inline and block level elements are effected
 + All descendants are affected, not just children

The alignment effects of these markup constructs propagate through their
descendants until another such markup-originating alignment modifier is
encountered. At this point, further descendants are affected by the
alignment attribute of the closer ancestor.

Note that the CENTER element behaves exactly like DIV with an ALIGN
attribute set to "center". This is in agreement with HTML 4.01 spec. which
describes CENTER as shorthand for DIV with an ALIGN attribute set to
"center".

Note also that TD without an ALIGN attribute set is treated like TD with an
ALIGN attribute set to "left". This default implied ALIGN attribute behaves
precisely like a stated ALIGN attribute; its effects propagate though
descendants and it blocks the propagation of any markup-originating
alignment effects of if its ancestors. Similarly, TH is tantamount to TH
with an ALIGN attribute set to "center".

Internet Explorer
-----------------

Standards:

 - Behaves in the same way as Firefox, except that table cells without
   ALIGN attributes set don't block alignment propagation / inheritance.
   Table cells behave like a DIV with no ALIGN attribute.

Quirks:

 - Behaves in exactly the same way as Firefox.
