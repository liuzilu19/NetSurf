LibParserUtils -- a utility library for parser building
=======================================================

Overview
--------

  LibParserUtils provides various pieces of functionality that are useful
  when writing parsers.

Requirements
------------

  LibParserUtils requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Perl (for the testcases)
    + Pkg-config (for the testcases)

  For enhanced charset support, LibParserUtils may also be configured to use
  an iconv() implementation.

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the parser is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources 
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
