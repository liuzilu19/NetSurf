TODO list
=========

  + Sort out the mess that is dom_ctx - I really don't like it; everything (except dom_strings)
    should be allocated in the context of a document and, thus, the context is easily found 
    through foo->owner->blah. dom_strings are somewhat awkward here, as they aren't necessarily
    allocated in the context of a document, but they still need access to an allocator. Perhaps
    the simplest solution is for the string constructors to take an allocator and private word
    as parameters, then store them within the string. This does, however, add an overhead of 
    8 (or 16 on 64bit platforms) bytes per dom_string, which isn't exactly great.
  + Fill out stub functions for DOM3 core
  + Rest of DOM level 3
  + DOM level 2
  + DOM level 1
