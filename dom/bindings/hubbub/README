Hubbub binding for libdom
=========================

Overview
--------

  This is an example binding of hubbub to libdom. It consists of two,
  orthogonal, parts:
  
    1) hubbub parser wrapper
    2) hubbub-specific DOMImplementationSource for libdom

Push parser wrapper
-------------------

  This is a wrapper around hubbub's parser API, to facilitate
  construction of a libdom DOM tree. The basic premise is that the wrapper
  intercepts the SAX-like events emitted by hubbub's tokeniser then builds
  a libdom DOM tree from them.

DOMImplementationSource
-----------------------

  The DOMImplementationSource exposes the APIs needed to create a new
  document based upon the hubbub binding. It also provides the utility
  functions that libdom uses when performing some operations (such as
  document normalization). This is needed as libdom is document language
  agnostic; therefore, it requires support from the binding to perform
  some operations.
