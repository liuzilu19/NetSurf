Iconv -- a character set conversion library and RISC OS module
==============================================================

Overview
--------

  Iconv is a library which provides character set conversion through an 
  implementation of the C iconv() function. It also provides a RISC OS
  module.

Requirements
------------

  Iconv requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + The RISC OS Unicode Library
    + Perl (for the testcases)
    + Pkg-config (for the testcases)

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the library is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources 
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
