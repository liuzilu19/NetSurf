About Iconv
===========

Iconv is a module providing character set conversion facilities for 
third-party applications. It is currently used by a number of 
applications, most notably NetSurf. UnixLib's iconv support also requires 
this module.

Updating from earlier versions
==============================

If updating from earlier versions, please perform _both_ a !Boot and 
!System merge with the contents of the Iconv distribution archive as 
documented in the Installation section of the ReadMe file.

Where to get it
===============

Iconv may be downloaded from http://www.netsurf-browser.org/projects/iconv/
