Unicode library
---------------

The contents of this directory must be obtained from RISC OS Open.

For the timebeing, it is necessary to apply the supplied patch to the
UnicodeLib source tree. Something like:

  patch -p0 -i unicode.jmb1.p

should do the trick.

The include directory should contain the exported headers:

 + autojp.h
 + charsets.h
 + combine.h
 + encoding.h
 + iso10646.h
 + iso3166.h
 + languages.h
 + unictype.h
 + utf8.h
 + utf16.h

The lib directory should contain the library compiled for the host platform:

 + libunicode.a (renamed from ucodelib.a)

The libro directory should contain the library compiled for RISC OS:

 + libunicode.a (renamed from ucodelib.a)

If wanting to build the RISC OS module, ensure that the library was built with 
-mmodule. Otherwise, linking will fail with differing FP implementations.
