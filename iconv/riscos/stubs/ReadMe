Iconv module stubs
==================

This directory contains the source code required to build suitable stubs
for interfacing with the Iconv module from C. The stubs provide the standard
iconv_open, iconv, and iconv_close API entry points.

UnixLib users should use the veneers provided by that library. These stubs are
provided for the convenience of those using the Shared C Library, or other
runtime.
